# Readium

A wordpress theme inspired by Medium.com.

It's really great.

## Notes on Using

This theme has been customized to be used on a specific site. While the header image can be customized using the WP Customize settings, the colors must be changed in the css/style.less file (then the stylesheet would need to be recompiled.) Therefore, if you want to use this theme, you'll probably want to branch it and make you changes.

You can contact me or file an issue if you need any help.
